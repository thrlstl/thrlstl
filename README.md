### 𝘐𝘥𝘦𝘢 & 𝘍𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯

Last October (2020), I conceptualized an application that would solve a small inconvenience. My friends and I would often have long text message threads, discussing photos we loved, hated, needed a different filter, etc., before posting them on our Instagram or another social media app.

I knew I could build an app to make this collaborative effort more straightforward and fun. With Greenlite, we could bucket all of our photos in group albums, privately like/dislike, and upload photo versions all in one interface. Better yet, we could filter an album based on responses.

Flash forward to my final three weeks in Flatiron School's Software Engineering immersive, Greenlite finally came to life. I had one week to conceptualize and design, one week to build, and the final week to touch up and present! Not all of Greenlite's features are ready—but the foundation is strong while I continue to discover, refactor and develop.

### 𝘍𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦𝘴 & 𝘐𝘮𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘗𝘳𝘰𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴

- 𝗔𝗺𝗮𝘇𝗼𝗻 / 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗦𝟯 — I'm in the process of implementing a dedicated file storage service like S3. Currently, I host the backend API on Heroku, which is ephemeral, not supportive of persistent file storage. Meaning, photos in Greenlite's database are only visible for a short period or while developing in my local environment.
- 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 — Users should be able to add collaborators to a collection when it's created or later.
- 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 — Users should be able to filter a collection by photos liked or disliked by collaborators.
- 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗦𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲 — Users should be able to change the appearance of a collections view. (list or grid)
- 𝗣𝗵𝗼𝘁𝗼 𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄 — Users should be able to expand a photo when single-clicked.
- 𝗦𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗮 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗹 — Users should be able to save to camera roll when they press and hold a photo.
